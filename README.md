## EdTech
EdTech, a combination of "education" and "technology" refers to hardware and software designed to enhance teacher-led learning in classrooms and improve students' education outcomes. This is a platform that allows instructors to build online courses on their preferred topics. Using EdTech course development tools, they can upload videos recordings to create courses. Users can take courses to earn credit towards technical skills. Courses are designed to help users learn or enhance a particular skill. Every student who enrolls a course can also take a test and assess their knowledge on the course.

## Quick Start
- npm install : Install dependencies
- npm run seed : To seed the database with courses, users, and reviews.

- Students can Enroll into the course and access the course materials and User will be able to track the progress of a particular course which will be shown in the user profile.
- Search feature allows users to search for a course by course name available in course tab. The filter feature also allows users to sort courses based on the branch.
